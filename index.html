				<div class="about">
					<p>
						I am a back-end and front-end web developer, software programmer, and junior
						at RPI. I have been developing web sites since I was in high school, and I am
						very passionate about creating high quality products that users will enjoy.
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						While I work a lot with back-end development, I also have a lot of experience
						with front-end development and design. The functionality must be there, but
						the design of a web page or application is critical for making it usable, for
						functionality is nothing without usability.
					</p>
					
					<br/>
					
					<p>
						I spend a lot of my free time working on personal projects, such as
						a tournament system for the online community game Mega Man Battle Network Cyber
						Tournament. I also have several interesting projects from my time at school; for
						example, I worked with a group of RPI students to help a local Troy craft ice cream 
						store. We made them a public website, employee scheduling system, a clock-in/clock-out
						system, and a digital menu display system. You can learn more about these projects below.

						I have a wide variety of experience with several programming languages, spanning from PHP,
						HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery to C++, C, Java, and Python. I also have experience using
						Adobe products like Illustrator and Photoshop, as well as Sony Vegas Pro and Microsoft Office.
						You can view how comfortable I am with these skills on the <a href="skills.html">Skills</a> page.
